There are 3 problems with multi-threading approach across functions:
The first problem:
    we don't have any guarantee that we are dealing with commutative functions.

    it means that the order of executing the functions might be important.
The second problem:
    the data object is not thread safe, we might access an element from 2 different threads and deal with data corruption.
The third problem:
    we do not control on the number of threads that being created. we might deal with heavy context switching.


One possible solution - implemented in Solution1.java
Second possible solution - implemented in Solution2.java
